# Overview
The goal of this team project is to use Scrum practices to collaborate with team members. We created the public and private repositories and configured a team SSL certificate during sprint 0. The database has been set up, and each member has contributed to the READme.md file.

We've split up the work and scheduled team calls to go over our progress. If a team member encounters a problem, we collaborate to resolve it.
